You're welcome to dive in and work as you please, but if you're feeling at a loss where to begin, follow the scaffold below. Don't forget to start from our [template](template.qmd) and look at the [example report](example_project/example_project.qmd).

## Project scaffold

### Step 0: Pick a dataset

We have nine datasets for you to choose from. **We recommend saving your data inside your project**.

| Dataset | Description | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [World populations](../data_sources/population.csv) | A summary of world populations and corresponding statistics | Data from a [Tidy Tuesday post on 2014 CIA World Factbook data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-10-22/readme.md)
| [Soccer players](../data_sources/Players2024.csv) | A summary of approx. 6000 soccer players from 2024 | Data from a [Kaggle submission](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asemmustafa/football-players-2024-dataset).
| [Coffee survey](../data_sources/coffee_survey.csv) | A survey of blind coffee tasting results | Data from a [Kaggle submission](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/lets-do-some-coffee-tasting)
| [Gapminder](../data_sources/gapminder.csv) | GDP and life expectancy data by country | Data from the [Research Bazaar's R novice tutorial](https://github.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder), sourced from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/).
| [Melbourne housing data](../data_sources/melb_data.csv) | A collection of houses for sale in Melbourne. | Data from a [Kaggle submission](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot) | 
| [Goodreads books](../data_sources/books.csv) | A summary of books on Goodreads. | Data from a [Kaggle submission](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks)
| [Queensland hospitals](../data_sources/hospital_data.csv) | Queensland emergency department statistics. | Data from the Queensland Government's [Open Data Portal](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/emergency-departments-quarterly-data). |
| [Queensland fuel prices](../data_sources/qld_fuel.csv) | Fuel prices by the pump in Queensland | Data from the Queensland Government's [Open Data Portal](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/fuel-price-reporting-2024)
| [Aeroplane bird strikes](../data_sources/birds_strikes.csv) | Aeroplane bird strike incidents fron the 90s| Data from a [Tidy Tuesday post](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/2500765853ea5235409d936cf9bbbf7d5f8b6881/data/2019/2019-07-23) sourced from an [FAA database](https://wildlife.faa.gov/home)

Remember, to load the data into Python we need to import the `pandas` module and use the `read_csv()` function.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("path_to_data")
```

### Step 1: Understand the data

The datasets are varied with respect to variable types and content. The first exercise you should complete is a overview of the data. Use the following techniques to do so.

**Your goal: identify which variables are discrete (categorical) and which are continuous.**

#### Viewing the data structure

Use the following functions to view your data and the underlying data types.

```python
df.columns
df.info()
df.describe()
```

#### Picking out individual columns

To view the contents of particular columns, you can select them via indexing

```python
df["column_name"]
df["column_name"].unique()
df["column_name"].describe()
```

You can also apply other statistics to the column, like `.max()`.

### Step 2: Taking a subset

The datasets have lots of observations for lots of variables. To draw meaningful results, it's often useful to take a subset of those.

**Your goal: filter by a condition or group by and aggregate over a particular variable**

#### Filtering

Recall that filtering looks like indexing. If you only want to examine a certain subset of a variable, the following code will isolate that subset

```python
condition = df["column_to_filter"]...
subset = df[condition]
```

For example, if you only want "Australia" for a dataset with a "country" column, you might use 

```python
condition = df["country"] == "Australia"
```

#### Grouping

If you want to aggregate over a particular variable you need to group by it. This answers questions like, what is the average $x$ for every $y$.

If you want to group by a column and, for each of its values, apply a statistic **to all the others**,

```python
summary = df.groupby("column_to_group_by").agg("statistic")
```

If you only want to apply aggregation to some columns, we can pick them out

```python
summary = df.groupby("column_to_group_by")["column_to_aggregate"].agg("statistic")
```

> Hint: if you want to visualise the grouping variable, you might want to use `df.groupby("column", as_index = False)...` to keep it as a column

### Step 3: Visualise the relationship between variables

With your summary dataset, you can now try to visualise your variables.

**Your goal: create a visualisation of one to three variables in your summary data**.

First, you need to import the `seaborn` module

```python
import seaborn as sns
```

Next, you'll need to identify the variables to visualise. If they're both continuous, you could use a scatter or line plot

```python
sns.relplot(data = summary, x = ..., y = ..., kind = ..., ...)
```

If one of them is categorical, you could use a barplot or boxplot

```python
sns.catplot(data = summary, x = ..., y = ..., kind = ..., ...)
```

You could also consider a histogram, looking at one continuous variable

```python
sns.displot(data = summary, x = ..., ...)
```


### Step 4: Looking ahead

Now that you've performed your first analysis and visualisation of the dataset, use these results to inform your next analysis!
