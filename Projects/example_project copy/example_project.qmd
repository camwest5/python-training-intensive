```{python}
#| code-summary: "Set up code"

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import seaborn as sns

df_raw = pd.read_csv("../../data_sources/Players2024.csv")
```

## A glimpse at the dataset

We'll begin just by taking a glimpse at the dataset:

```{python}
df_raw.head(10)
```

## Cleaning the data
The data had a few issues, as the following plot shows:

```{python}
sns.catplot(df_raw, x = "positions", y = "height_cm")
```

It looks like some of the players' positions and heights were recorded incorrectly. To clean, let's remove the "Missing" positions and ensure that heights are reasonable:

```{python}
#| code-fold: show

df = df_raw.copy()

# Remove missing position
df = df[df["positions"] != "Missing"]

# Ensure reasonable heights
df = df[df["height_cm"] > 100]
```

To confirm, let's plot the outliers in a different colour

```{python}
# Identify outliers
outliers = pd.concat([df_raw,df]).drop_duplicates(keep = False)

sns.catplot(df, x = "positions", y = "height_cm")
sns.stripplot(outliers, x = "positions", y = "height_cm", color = "r")
```

## Visualising the players' heights

After cleaning the data we can now analyse the players' heights to see if there's differences between positions. A box plot can show the distribution of heights:

```{python}
#| title: Goalkeepers tend to be taller
#| fig-alt: "A scatterplot of the relationsip between height and position."

sns.catplot(data = df, x = "positions", y = "height_cm", kind = "box", order = ["Goalkeeper", "Defender", "Midfield", "Attack"])
plt.xlabel("Position")
plt.ylabel("Height (cm)")
plt.savefig("tb.png")
plt.show()
```

It looks like goalkeepers are taller than the rest! 

Let's through the age variable into the mix, to see if players' heights allow them to compete longer.

```{python}
px.scatter(data_frame = df, x = "age", y = "height_cm", color = "positions",
           facet_col = "positions", facet_col_wrap = 2, hover_name = "name",
           hover_data = "nationality", labels = {"height_cm": "Height (cm)",
                                                 "positions": "Position"})
```


It doesn't look like there's a relationship between heights and ages, but clearly it affects their position!

## Global spread

We haven't looked at the nationality column yet. Let's draw up a map using plotly to see where the players come from. 

```{python}

# Change country names to match plotly reference
df["nationality"] = df["nationality"].replace(["England", "Türkiye", "Cote d'Ivoire", 
                                               "Northern Ireland", "Wales"], 
                                               ["United Kingdom", "Turkey", "Ivory Coast",
                                                "United Kingdom", "United Kingdom"])

# Make the count
countries = df.value_counts("nationality")

# Make the plot
px.choropleth(locations = countries.index, locationmode = "country names", color = countries,
              labels = {"locations": "Country", "color": "# of players"})
```

Looks like most players are from Europe. Pan and zoom to see the finer details.
