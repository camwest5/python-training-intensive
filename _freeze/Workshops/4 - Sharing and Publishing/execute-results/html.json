Specifically, we look at:\n\n* How to create code-dependent documents, dashboards and presentation using Quarto\n* How to create a Git repository on GitHub and add files to it\n* How Git can help record a clean history of a project and collaborate with others\n* How Git and GitHub integrate with different tools\n\n## Quarto\n\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is a publishing system that allows creating documents, presentations, websites and dashboards that contain prose, code and code outputs. This means that such outputs can detail exactly what happened to the data, and outputs can be re-generated very quickly if, for example, the underlying dataset was updated, or if the analysis needs to change.\n\n### Installing Quarto\n\nThe simplest way to install Quarto is with Anaconda.\n\n1. Open an \"Anaconda prompt\" from the navigator\n2. Run `conda install conda-forge::quarto`\n3. When prompted with `Continue? ([y]/n)`, type `y` and press <kbd>enter</kbd>\n4. Restart the Spyder kernel and type \n\n```bash\n!quarto version\n```\n\nIf you get a number, then it's worked!\n\nAlternatively, follow the [instructions to install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) on your computer. Quarto is a command line tool available for all major operating systems.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nWe can write Quarto files in Spyder, but there is (at the time of writing) no integration of it into the Spyder interface. Other IDEs make it easier to interact with Quarto functions and write Quarto files, like R Studio.\n::: \n\nIf the IPython console can't find Quarto, try to run `quarto version` (without the `!`) in a command line interface outside Spyder (bash, macOS's Terminal, PowerShell...). You will have to use the tool that finds Quarto to run Quarto commands later.\n\n### Create a Quarto file\n\nLet's try to create a document based on the visualisations we created earlier. First, create a new script. Then, save it as \"document.qmd\" - be sure to change the extension!\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nWhen rendering individual Quarto files, paths to files (like the one you use to import some data) will be understood as `relative to the file itself`. This means that, to avoid confusion, it is best to save your Quarto file at the top of your project directory, so you can use the same relative paths as in the rest of your scripts.\n:::\n\n\nThis new `.qmd` script is a *Quarto Markdown* file. Markdown is a formatting language which we'll go through shortly.\n\nAt the top of our script, we need to include a header which contains the document settings\n\n```yml\n---\ntitle: Reproducible Output\nauthor: Your Name\ndate: 2025-01-01\n---\n```\n\n> The language used for the header is actually YAML (yet another markup language).\n\nThe remainder of the document uses the Markdown language, interspersed by Python chunks. Markdown works by using symbols to indicate formatting. For example, headings use hashtags `#` and bold text uses asterisks `* *`:\n\n```markdown\n# Markdown example\n\nThis contains **bold** and *italicised* text. You can also ~~strikethrough~~, create\n\n## Subheading\n\n- unordered \n- lists\n\nand \n\n1. ordered\n2. lists\n    1. with\n    2. levels\n\n```\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" appearance=\"minimal\"}\n# Markdown example\n\n\n\nThis contains **bold** and *italicised* text. You can also ~~strikethrough~~, create\n\n## Subheading\n\n- unordered \n- lists\n\nand \n\n1. ordered\n2. lists\n    1. with\n    2. levels\n\n:::\n\n:::  {.callout-tip}\nSee [more Markdown hints in the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).\n:::\n\nLet's make a simple markdown file and render it with quarto. In your file, write a simple document like the following:\n```markdown\n# Quarto document workshop\n\nThis is a simple Quarto markdown file, which will render **formatted text**!\n```\n\nThen, then in your **Spyder terminal**, render the document to produce an HTML output:\n\n```bash\n!quarto render document.qmd\n```\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\nYou may encounter a few issues which can be fixed:\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n# `ERROR: No valid input files passed to render`\n\nEither you've misspelt the filename, you've put he file in a folder, or the working directory is wrong. Once you've checked the spelling, \n\n**If `document.qmd` is in a folder**\n\nSpecify the filepath, not just the filename:\n\n```bash\n!quarto render folder_name/document.qmd\n```\n\n**If the working directory is wrong**\n\nMake sure you're in the Spyder project for intensives. You can check this by opening Spyder's \"files\" pane (above the console) to see where your working directory is. \n\nIf you need to change it, the easiest way is to open the Spyder project you created in a previous workshop. \n\nIf this doesn't work, or you want to be somewhere else, you can either create a new project or change your working directory manually with the file button in the top right.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n# `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '...'`\n\nYou're trying to import a module that Python can't find. This is a Python problem, not a Quarto problem. Check the erroneous line, which will start with \n\n```python\nimport some_module\n```\n\nand check that you've spelt the module correctly. If it's still broken, then you need to install the package (you don't have it on your computer). \n\n**Installing modules for Anaconda users**\n\nIf you installed the Anaconda distribution to set up Spyder (and you haven't manually changed environments - you'd know if you did), then use the following command to *install* the module\n\n```bash\nconda install some_module\n```\n\n**Installing modules with `pip`**\n\nIf you aren't using Anaconda then you can use the `pip` package to install the module. You can do so with\n\n```bash\npip install some_module\n```\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n# `NameError: name 'quarto' is not defined`\n\nYou've probably forgotten the exclamation mark: make sure to use it if you're in Spyder\n\n```bash\n!quarto render document.qmd\n```\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n# `error: incomplete escape \\U at position 28\n\nYou've probably forgotten the exclamation mark: make sure to use it if you're in Spyder\n\n```bash\n!quarto render document.qmd\n```\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n# `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`\n\nTry running \n\n```bash\n!quarto help\n```\n\n**If this returns a list of commands**\n\nThen something's wrong with your render command. Double check it's the same as here, and make sure nothing else is on the line.\n\n**If this returns the same error**\n\nThen you won't be able to use Spyder, and will need to use a command prompt instead. See the note **Not using Spyder** below.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n# `'quarto' is not recognized as an internal or external command...` or `quarto: command not found` etc.\n\n\n\nSomething's wrong with your Quarto installation. Check that you've installed it correctly and ask for help from a trainer.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n# Missing Python kernel\n\nYou might have to install jupyter. See options for different package managers in the [Quarto documentation about Python](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html#installation). If you're running into this issue and using Anaconda, please ask for assistance.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n# Nothing is happening\n\nSometimes Quarto is a bit slow, particularly if you've got a lot to render. If you've waited for over one minute, and there's a red square in the console's top right, then ask a trainer for help. To troubleshoot, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Cancel the operation (press the red square)\n2. Run `!quarto help`. This should be quick - if it's not, then you might need to use a terminal, see the **Not using Spyder** note below.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Not using Spyder\n\nIf you're using a different IDE, you might not be able to use `!quarto ...`. \n\n**If you're using Jupyter notebooks**\n\nThen you probably can. Try running \n\n```bash\n!quarto render document.qmd\n```\n\nand seeing if an error arises.\n\n**If you're using an alternative or have encountered issues within Spyder**\n\nYou'll need to use a command prompt to run the Quarto commands. Give it a go yourself, and then ask a trainer for assistance if you're having trouble.\n\n1. Open a command prompt / shell on your device. \n2. Navigate to your project folder with the command `cd` to change directories:\n\n```bash\ncd path/to/your/project/\n```\n\nYou can find the path inside Spyder - it's the address in the top right.\n\n3. Use the render command *without* the exclamation mark:\n\n```bash\nquarto render document.qmd\n```\n:::\n\n\nOnce it's finished, you should see a new file in your project folder: \"document.html\". Open it in your browser.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nRight click on the file and press \"Open externally\" within Spyder.\n:::\n\n### Including Python\n\nWe can include Python chunks for quarto to execute before rendering our file. Returning to the `.qmd` file, we fence code chunks with backticks\n\n```{{python}}\nprint(\"This code will be executed\")\n```\n\nPlacing this chunk into our file and then rendering again with `!quarto render document.qmd`, you should see the code block *and* its output in the document, like this\n\n::: {#14a7f07e .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(\"This code will be executed\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThis code will be executed\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Building an example report\n\nWe'll now look to using Python and markdown to develop a report with Quarto. Let's start by bringing in some of the work we did yesterday.\n\nWe'll start with set up message and import the packages and data:\n\n````\n## Import the data\n\nLet's import the packages and data\n\n```{{python}}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"Players2024.csv\")\n```\n````\n\nWe can then follow by plotting it the data\n\n````\n## Plot the data\n\nLet's generate that **swarm plot** again:\n\n```{{python}}\nsns.catplot(data = df, x = \"positions\", y = \"height_cm\")\n```\n\nWe now have a plot!\n````\n\n\n### Cell options\n\nAs the default Quarto output is a HTML file, we can include interactive visualisations too.\n\nLet's say we also want to let our readers know that they need to install Plotly in order to create interactive visualisations. If you want to show the corresponding code in your document but don't want to run it, you can add the cell option `#| eval: false`. (And if you want to show the output but not show the underlying code, use `#| echo: false`.)\n\n````\n## Interactive plots\n\nYou will need the plotly module:\n\n```{{python}}\n#| eval: false\nconda install plotly\n```\n\nAn interactive plot:\n\n```{{python}}\n#| echo: false\nimport plotly.express as px\npx.scatter(data_frame = df, x = \"age\", y = \"height_cm\")\n```\n````\n\nAnd for adding a caption and alternative text to a figure:\n\n```{{python}}\n#| fig-cap: \"Goalkeepers tend to be taller.\"\n#| fig-alt: \"A scatterplot of the relationsip between height and position.\"\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.catplot(data = df, x = \"positions\", y = \"height_cm\")\n```\n\n[Many more cell options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) exist, including captioning and formatting visualisations. Note that these options can be used at the cell level as well as globally (by modifying the front matter at the top of the document).\n\nFor example, to make sure error and warning messages are never shown:\n\n```yml\n---\ntitle: Reproducible Output\nauthor: Your Name\ndate: 2025-01-01\nwarning: false\nerror: false\n---\n```\n### Output formats\n\nThe default output format in Quarto is HTML, which is by far the most flexible. However, Quarto is a very versatile publishing system and can generate many different output formats, including PDF, DOCX and ODT, slide formats, Markdown suited for GitHub... and even whole blogs, books and dashboards.\n\nLet's try rendering a PDF by including the `format: pdf` option at the top of the file:\n\n```yml\n---\ntitle: Reproducible Output\nauthor: Your Name\ndate: 2025-01-01\nformat: pdf\n---\n```\n\nWhen rendering PDFs, the first issue we might run into is the lack of a LaTeX distribution. If Quarto didn't detect one, it will suggest to install tinytex (a minimal LaTeX distribution) with:\n\n```bash\n!quarto install tinytex\n```\n\nOnce that is installed, Quarto should render a PDF.\n\nAnother issue with our example document is that an interactive HTML visualisation won't be renderd in the PDF. You can supress it by using the `#| eval: false` option:\n\n```{{python}}\n#| eval: false\nimport plotly.express as px\npx.scatter(data_frame = df, x = \"age\", y = \"height_cm\")\n``` \n\n\n<!-- #### Dashboard\n\nA great way to present a variety of outputs in a grid is by creating a HTML dashboard.\n\nLet's modify our script to render a dashboard. First, change the output format:\n\n```python\n# %% [markdown]\n# ---\n# title: Reproducible Output\n# author: Your Name\n# date: 2025-01-01\n# format: dashboard\n# ---\n```\n\nWe can already render the dashboard and see the result. Each panel can be expanded with the bottom-right button. Note that by default:\n\n* each cell is rendered in a separate card\n* headings define the rows\n* the heading text is discarded\n* code is not shown (but can be by using `echo: true`)\n\nGiven this default behaviour, you might have to rethink a good part of your script to make it suited for a striking dashboard. For example, removing most of the text, customising the layout (tabsets, rows, card heights...) and adding custom cards like \"value boxes\". Learn more about all these in the [Quarto Dashboards documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/).\n\nAs a starting point, copy the current script across to a new script called `dashboard.py` and modify it so it matches the following:\n```python\n# %% [markdown]\n# ---\n# title: Reproducible Outputs\n# author: Your Name\n# date: today\n# warning: false\n# error: false\n# format: dashboard\n# ---\n\n# %%\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"Players2024.csv\")\n\n# %% [markdown]\n\"\"\"\n## Figures {height=70%}\n\"\"\"\n\n# %%\n#| title: Goalkeepers tend to be taller\n#| fig-alt: \"A scatterplot of the relationsip between height and position.\"\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.catplot(data = df, x = \"positions\", y = \"height_cm\")\n\n# %%\n#| title: Age vs Height\nimport plotly.express as px\npx.scatter(data_frame = df, x = \"age\", y = \"height_cm\")\n\n# %% [markdown]\n\"\"\"\n## Table\n\"\"\"\n\n# %%\n#| title: A glimpse at the dataset\ndf.head(10)\n```\n\nThis results in a dashboard containing three cards organised in two rows. The top row uses 70% of the available height, and the bottom row shows a table of the top 10 rows of the dataset. Each card has a title.\n\n![Quarto dashboard with three cards: static visualisation, interactive visualisation, and table.](img/dashboard.png)\n\n### Themes\n\nTo quickly style your dashboard differently, you can use a Bootstrap theme in your header like so:\n\n```\n# %% [markdown]\n# ---\n# title: Reproducible Outputs\n# author: Your Name\n# date: today\n# warning: false\n# error: false\n# format:\n#   dashboard:\n#     theme: quartz\n# ---\n```\n\nSee [a list of what other themes are available](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/theming.html). \n-->\n\n## Git and GitHub\n\n**Git** is a version control system that allows to record a clean history of your project, track precise authorship, and collaborate asynchronously with others. It can be used offline, from the command line or with integration into Integrated Desktop Environments (like RStudio, VS Code... Unfortunately, Spyder does not have Git integration).\n\n**GitHub** is one of many websites that allow you to host project that are tracked with Git. But even without using Git at all, it is possible to use GitHub to share and make your project public. Many researchers use it to make their code public alongside a published paper, to increase reproducibility and transparency. It can also be useful to build and share a portfolio of your work.\n\nLearning about the ins and out of Git takes time, so in this section we will mainly use GitHub as a place to upload and share your code and outputs, and as a starting point for learning more about Git in the future.\n\n### GitHub\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/) is currently the most popular place for hosting, sharing and collaborating on code. You can create an account for free, and then create a **repository** for your project.\n\n1. Create an account and log in\n1. Click on the \"+\" button (top right of the page)\n1. Select \"New repository\"\n1. Choose a name and description for your repository\n1. Tick \"Add a README file\" - this will be where you introduce your project\n1. Click \"Create repository\"\n\nFrom there, you can upload your files, and edit text-based files straight from your web browser if you need to.\n\nThe README file is a markdown file that can contain the most important information about your project. It's important to populate it as it is the first document most people see. It could contain:\n\n* Name and description of the project\n* How to use it (installation process if any, examples...)\n* Who is the author, who maintains it\n* How to contribute\n\nFor inspiration, see the [pandas README file](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas?tab=readme-ov-file#pandas-powerful-python-data-analysis-toolkit).\n\nTo practice managing a git repository on GitHub, try creating a personal portfolio repository where you can showcase what you have worked on and the outputs your are most proud of.\n\n## Further resources\n\n* Some alternatives to GitHub: [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com)\n* [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/)\n* [Course on Git from the command line](https://github.com/uqlibrary/technology-training/blob/master/Git/git.md)\n* [Course on Git with GitHub](https://github.com/uqlibrary/technology-training/blob/master/Git/GitHub/GitHub_intro.md)\n* [How to use GitHub Pages to publish Quarto outputs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)\n\n",
