If you have used RStudio to interact with R before, you should feel right at home: Spyder is a program designed for doing data science with Python.\nPython can be used interactively in a console, or we can build scripts and programs with it, making the most out of Spyder’s code editor.\nWe will start by using the console to work interactively. This is our direct line to the computer, and is the simplest way to run code. Don’t worry about any unfamiliar language, fonts or colours - we can ignore most of it for now - all you need to know is that\n\nIn [1]: ... is code that we’ve sent to the computer, and\nOut[1]: ... is its response.",

    "title": "The Fundamentals",
    "section": "Variables",
    "text": "Variables\nLike language, Python has nouns and verbs. We call the nouns variables: they are the ‘things’ we manipulate with our code.\nEssentially, a variable is a named container. We access it by its name, and we get its value.\nTo create a variable, you need to choose a name and a value with name = value. For example\nexample_int = 42\nWhenever you use the variable’s name, Python will now access its value:\nexample_int\nWe can use the variables in place of the values\nexample_float = 5.678\nproduct = example_int * example_float\nproduct\n\nSpyder helps us with extra panels and features apart from the Console. To see what variables you have created, look at the “Variable explorer” tab in the top right.\n\n\nTypes\nVariables have different types. So far, we’ve just looked at storing numbers, of which there are three types:\n\nint - integers store whole numbers, e.g. 1, 5, 1000, -3.\nfloat - floating point numbers store decimals and scientific notation, e.g. 1.5, -8.97, 4e-6.\ncomplex - complex numbers express the imaginary unit with j, e.g. z = 1+2j is \\(z = 1+2i\\).\n\nLet’s look at some other types\n\nBooleans\nEven simpler than integers is the boolean type. These are either 1 or 0 (True or False), representing a single binary unit (bit). Don’t be fooled by the words, these work like numbers: True + True gives 2.\nexample_bool = True\n\nIn Python, the boolean values True and False must begin with a capital letter.\n\n\n\nStrings\nLet’s look at variable types which aren’t (necessarily) numbers. Sequences are variables which store multiple pieces of data. For example, strings store a sequence of characters and are created with quotation marks 'blah blah blah' or \"blah blah blah\":\nexample_string = 'This is an example of a string!'\n\n\nLists\nWe can also create lists, which will store several variables (not necessarily of the same type). We need to use square brackets for that:\nexample_numbers = [38, 3, 54, 17, 7]\nexample_diverse = [3, 'Hi!', 9.0]\nLists are very flexible as they can contain any number of items, and any type of data. You can even nest lists inside a list, which makes for a very flexible data type.\nOperations on sequences are a bit different to numbers. We can still use + and *, but they will concatenate (append) and duplicate, rather than perform arithmetic.\nexample_string + ' How are you?'\nexample_numbers + example_diverse\n3 * example_numbers\nHowever, depending on the variable, some operations won’t work:\nsentence + favNumber\nThere are other data types like tuples, dictionaries and sets, but we won’t look at those in this session. Here’s a summary of the ones we’ve covered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nType\nShort name\nExample\nGenerator\n\n\n\n\nNumeric\nInteger\nint\n3\nint()\n\n\nNumeric\nFloating Point Number\nfloat\n4.2\nfloat()\n\n\nNumeric\nBoolean\nbool\nTrue\nbool()\n\n\nSequence\nString\nstr\n'A sentence '\n\" \" or ' ' or str()\n\n\nSequence\nList\nlist\n['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n[ ] or list()\n\n\n\nThe generator commands are new. We use these to manually change the variable type. For example,\nint(True)\nyields 1, converting a boolean into an integer. These commands are functions, as opposed to variables - we’ll look at functions a bit later.\n\n\n\nIndexing\nWe can access part of a sequence by indexing. Sequences are ordered, starting at 0, so the first element has index 0, the second index 1, the third 2 and so on. For example, see what these commands return:\nexample_string[0]\nexample_string[6]\nexample_numbers[4]\nIf you want more than one element in a sequence, you can slice. Simple slices specify a range to slice, from the first index to the last, but not including the last. For example:\nmyList[0:4]\nThat command returns elements from position 0 up to - but not including! - position 4.",

    "section": "Modules",
    "text": "Modules\nPython, on its own, requires a lot of manual programming for advanced tasks. What makes it versatile is the capacity to use other people’s code with modules.\nTo bring in advanced variables and functions that other’s have made, we need to import the module. For example\npi\nreturns an error, because it’s undefined. But the math module contains a variable called pi:\nimport math\nmath.pi\n\nTo access objects from within a module, we use a full stop: module.object_inside.\n\n\nNumPy for arrays\nArrays are a data type introduced by numpy, a module with many functions useful for numerical computing.\nFor example, you can convert the list we created before to then do mathematical operations on each one of its elements:\nimport numpy as np\nexample_array = np.array(example_numbers)\nexample_array * 2\n\n\nPandas for dataframes\npandas introduces dataframes, which are often used to store two-dimensional datasets with different kinds of variables in each column. If your data is stored as a spreadsheet, you probably want to import it with a pandas function.\nHere is an example of creating a pandas dataframe from scratch, populating it by hand:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create initial dataframe\ndf = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Name', 'Age'])\n\n# Populate with data\ndf.loc[1] = 'Josephine', 70\ndf.loc[2] = 'Dilsah', 38\n\ndf\n\nYou can double-click on a dataframe in the Variable explorer to explore it in a separate window.\n\n\n\nMatplotlib for visualisation\nmatplotlib is a large collection of data visualisation functions, and pyplot is a submodule of matplotlib that contains essentials.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot(example_array)\nThis shows a plot in the Plots tab of Spyder.\n\nIn a Python shell, you might have to use the plt.show() command to show the plot.\n\nThe default look is a line plot that joins all the points, but we can style a plot with only a few characters:\n# blue circles\nplt.plot(example_array, 'bo')\n\n# green squares, dashed line:\nplt.plot(example_array, 'gs--')\nExtra arguments can be used to style further:\n# red, diamonds, solid line; change width of line and size of diamonds:\nplt.plot(example_array, 'rd-', linewidth=3, markersize=10)\nTo find out about the styling shorthand and all other arguments, look at the documentation:\nplt.plot?\n\n\nInstalling modules that aren’t built in\nThe math module is built-in - the module came when I installed Python, and the numpy, pandas and matplotlib come with conda installations. Most other modules live online, so we need to download and install them first.\nInstalling modules depends on whether you have a conda environment or not. To check, run\nconda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage\nconda Environment?\n\n\n\n\nconda is a tool for managing and deployi... or something similar\nYes\n\n\nNameError: name 'conda' is not defined\nNo\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a conda environment\nYou can install packages with\nconda install package_name\n\nYou likely have a conda environment if you installed Anaconda or you installed Spyder 6 (Since Oct 2024)\n\n\n\nIf you do not have a conda environment\nYou can install packages with\npip install package_name\n\nYou likely have a pip environment if you installed Python manually and/or are not using Spyder\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Expres for interactive visualisations\nOne module that isn’t built-in is plotly, which we can use for interactive visualisations.\nimport plotly.io as pio\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Set renderer\npio.renderers.default='browser'\n\n# Create bar plot\npx.bar(df, x = \"Name\", y = \"Age\")",
