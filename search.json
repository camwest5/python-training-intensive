    "text": "Setting up\n\nIntroducing pandas\nPandas is a Python module that introduces dataframes to Python. It gives us the tools we need to clean and transform data with Python.\nTo be able to use the functions included in pandas, we have to first import it:\nimport pandas as pd\npd is the usual nickname for the pandas module.\n\nIf you get an error, like No module named 'pandas', you’ll need to install it first, using either conda install pandas or pip install pandas, depending on your Python installation.\n\n\nThe DataFrame object\nPandas is built upon one key feature: the DataFrame class. In Python we have different built-in types, like int for integers and string for characters. Pandas introduces a new type, DataFrame, which stores data like a spreadsheet.\n\n\n\nSetting up the workspace\nTo make life easy, we should set up our workspace well.\n\nOpen your project folder using your file explorer, and create a new folder called “data”.\nMove your data into this folder.\nNext, open your project in Spyder, and create a new script called “analysis.py”.\nOpen the “Files” tab in Spyder and check that you see two objects:\n\nThe file “analysis.py”\nThe folder “data”\n\n\n\n\nImporting data\nPandas offers a simple way to access data with its read.csv() function. We’ll save it into the variable df_raw:\ndf_raw = pd.read_csv(\"data/name_of_file_here.csv\")\n\nYou can also provide a URL instead of a file path!\n\n\n\nAside - File Paths and backslashes\nJust a quick detour to discuss file paths of which there are two types: absolute and relative\n\nAbsolute\nAbsolute file paths always start at the “top” of your file system, e.g. one of the drives (like C:) for Windows users, so they are never ambiguous. It’s like providing your full address from country to street number.\nC://Users/my_username/research/data/really_important_secret_data.csv\n\n\nRelative\nRelative file paths start from your current file location. For files in my current folder, I just provide their name - like referring to another house on your street as “number 7”. Let’s assume we’re in the research folder.\nfile_in_my_current_folder.csv\nWe can go to down folders from our current location:\ndata/really_important_secret_data.csv\nAnd we can go up folders from our current location\n../../this_file_is_two_levels_up.csv\nOr a combination of the two (e.g. up one, then down into a different folder)\n../not_research/this_file_is_not_research.csv\nWhat matters is that the relative reference depends on where your code is and will break if you move the script!\n\n\nBackslashes\nOne last note: Windows uses backslashes for their file paths\nC:\\\\Users\\...\nBut Python uses backslashes as an escape character. For example, \"\\n\" is a newline, \"\\u1234\" is the unicode character U+1234 and confusingly \"\\\\\" is a single backslash. So we have to modify all Windows file paths to either\nC:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\...\n\nOR\n\nC://Users/...\nYou can choose whichever you prefer.\n\n\n\nInitial look at the data\nLet’s get back to data.\nWe can investigate the size of the data thanks to the shape attribute attached to all pandas dataframes:\ndf_raw.shape\nThe dataset contains dozens of columns. What are their names?\ndf_raw.columns\nLet’s subset our data to focus on a handful of variables.\n\n\nCreating a backup\nData analysis in Python is safe because our variables are copies of the data - we aren’t actually changing the files until we explicitly overwrite them. However, Python also has no undo, so if I delete something in my analysis, I can’t get it back - I have to start all over again.\nOne way to mitigate this issue is by making a copy of the data\ndf = df_raw.copy()\nNow we have two variables: df is what we’ll use, and df_raw stores the raw data. If we ever need to restart, we can simply run df = df_raw.copy().",

    "text": "Accessing and Filtering Data\nSo how do we access our data in Python? We use a type of indexing introduced by pandas, which revolves around using square brackets after the dataframe: df[...].\n\nAccessing columns\nTo access a column, index with its name:\ndf[\"column_name\"]\nWe can access multiple by providing a list of names\n# Save the names in a list and then index\ncolumn_names = [\"name_1\", \"name_2\"]\ndf[column_names]\n\n# This is equivalent to\ndf[[\"name_1\", \"name_2\"]]\nIf we want to do anything with it (like statistics or visualisation), it’s worth saving the column(s) as a new variable\ndf_subset = df[[\"name_1\", \"name_2\"]]\n\n\nAccessing rows\nThere’s a few ways to access rows. The easiest is by slicing - if you want rows 5 to 10, use df[5 : 10]\n\nNote that the end row is not included\n\ndf[start_row : end_row]\nIf you want to access a single row, we need to use df.loc[] or df.iloc[]. These are the go-to methods for accessing data if the above indexing isn’t sufficient.\n\ndf.loc[] accesses rows by label (defaults to row number but could be anything)\ndf.iloc[] accesses rows by row number exclusively\n\nFor a single row\ndf.loc[row_label]\ndf.iloc[row_num]\nFinally, we can filter specific rows by a condition on one of the variables, e.g. only rows where variable \\(x &gt; 15\\).\ndf[df[\"column_x\"] &gt; 15]\n# Or any other condition\nAs with the column case, it’s useful to save this as a variable\ndf_filtered = df[df[\"column_x\"] &gt; 15]",

We can focus on a specific column instead, for example one that was hidden previously:\ndf[\"column\"].describe()\nOr a categorical column:\ndf[\"categorical_column\"].describe()\n\nFor a categorical column, the information shown is different: for example, how many unique values there are, and what the most common value is.\n\nWhat if you want specific statistics about a particular column? Usually there are methods available:\n# Applicable to all columns\ndf[\"column\"].count()\ndf[\"column\"].unique()\n\n# For numeric columns only\ndf[\"numeric_column\"].min()\ndf[\"numeric_column\"].max()\ndf[\"numeric_column\"].mean()\ndf[\"numeric_column\"].median()\ndf[\"numeric_column\"].std()\n# ...\nWe can use these methods to filter our data. For example, the row which has the maximum value of variable \\(x\\) is\nx_max = df[\"variable_x\"].max()\ndf[df[\"variable_x\"] == x_max]\n\n# Or in one line\ndf[df[\"variable_x\"] == df[\"variable_x\"].max()]\nbecause we are looking for the row in df[\"variable_x\"] (the whole column) that has the value df[\"variable_x\"].max().",

It’s the same process as overwriting existing columns - let’s make a new column called “zeroes” where every row is 0\ndf[\"zeroes\"] = 0\nWe can also send in a column, for example\ndf[\"copy_of_x\"] = df[\"column_x\"]\nPerhaps most usefully, we can manipulate the column we send in. For example, the deviation from the mean \\[|\\bar{x} - x_i|\\] can be computed for each row:\ncol_x = df[\"column_x\"]\navg_x = df[\"column_x\"].mean()\n\ndf[\"deviation_from_mean\"] = abs(col_x - avg_x)\n\n# Or all together on one line,\ndf[\"deviation_from_mean\"] = abs(df[\"column_x\"] -  df[\"column_x\"].mean())\nwhere abs(...) takes the absolute value\nNow that we have a clean dataset, we can expand it by calculating new interesting variables.\nFor example, we can first sum the three greenhouse gases (as they use the same unit), and then calculate how much CO2-equivalent is emitted per person. We can also add GDP per capita to the dataset.\nFor the total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2e:\ndf['co2e'] = df[['co2', 'methane', 'nitrous_oxide']].sum(axis=1)\nThe operation is done row-wise: we use axis=1 to specify that we apply the function in the column axis.\nYou can confirm by looking at the data that the NA values are skipped when calculating the sum. The help page for this method mentions the skipna argument, which is set to True by default:\ndf.sum?\nskipna : bool, default True\n    Exclude NA/null values when computing the result.\nAnd then, for the CO2e per capita and the GDP per capita:\ndf['co2e_pc'] = df.co2e / df.population\ndf['gdp_pc'] = df.gdp / df.population\nWe now have three extra columns in our dataset.",

    "section": "Variables",
    "text": "Variables\nLike language, Python has nouns and verbs. We call the nouns variables: they are the ‘things’ we manipulate with our code.\nEssentially, a variable is a named container. We access it by its name, and we get its value.\nTo create a variable, you need to choose a name and a value with name = value. For example\nexample_int = 42\nWhenever you use the variable’s name, Python will now access its value:\nexample_int\nWe can use the variables in place of the values\nexample_float = 5.678\nproduct = example_int * example_float\nproduct\n\nSpyder helps us with extra panels and features apart from the Console. To see what variables you have created, look at the “Variable explorer” tab in the top right.\n\n\nTypes\nVariables have different types. So far, we’ve just looked at storing numbers, of which there are three types:\n\nint - integers store whole numbers, e.g. 1, 5, 1000, -3.\nfloat - floating point numbers store decimals and scientific notation, e.g. 1.5, -8.97, 4e-6.\ncomplex - complex numbers express the imaginary unit with j, e.g. z = 1+2j is \\(z = 1+2i\\).\n\nLet’s look at some other types\n\nBooleans\nEven simpler than integers is the boolean type. These are either 1 or 0 (True or False), representing a single binary unit (bit). Don’t be fooled by the words, these work like numbers: True + True gives 2.\nexample_bool = True\n\nIn Python, the boolean values True and False must begin with a capital letter.\n\n\n\nStrings\nLet’s look at variable types which aren’t (necessarily) numbers. Sequences are variables which store multiple pieces of data. For example, strings store a sequence of characters and are created with quotation marks 'blah blah blah' or \"blah blah blah\":\nexample_string = 'This is an example of a string!'\n\n\nLists\nWe can also create lists, which will store several variables (not necessarily of the same type). We need to use square brackets for that:\nexample_numbers = [38, 3, 54, 17, 7]\nexample_diverse = [3, 'Hi!', 9.0]\nLists are very flexible as they can contain any number of items, and any type of data. You can even nest lists inside a list, which makes for a very flexible data type.\nOperations on sequences are a bit different to numbers. We can still use + and *, but they will concatenate (append) and duplicate, rather than perform arithmetic.\nexample_string + ' How are you?'\nexample_numbers + example_diverse\n3 * example_numbers\nHowever, depending on the variable, some operations won’t work:\nsentence + favNumber\nThere are other data types like tuples, dictionaries and sets, but we won’t look at those in this session. Here’s a summary of the ones we’ve covered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nType\nShort name\nExample\nGenerator\n\n\n\n\nNumeric\nInteger\nint\n3\nint()\n\n\nNumeric\nFloating Point Number\nfloat\n4.2\nfloat()\n\n\nNumeric\nBoolean\nbool\nTrue\nbool()\n\n\nSequence\nString\nstr\n'A sentence '\n\" \" or ' ' or str()\n\n\nSequence\nList\nlist\n['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n[ ] or list()\n\n\n\nThe generator commands are new. We use these to manually change the variable type. For example,\nint(True)\nyields 1, converting a boolean into an integer. These commands are functions, as opposed to variables - we’ll look at functions a bit later.\n\n\n\nIndexing\nWe can access part of a sequence by indexing. Sequences are ordered, starting at 0, so the first element has index 0, the second index 1, the third 2 and so on. For example, see what these commands return:\nexample_string[0]\nexample_string[6]\nexample_numbers[4]\nIf you want more than one element in a sequence, you can slice. Simple slices specify a range to slice, from the first index to the last, but not including the last. For example:\nmyList[0:4]\nThat command returns elements from position 0 up to - but not including! - position 4.",

    "section": "Modules",
    "text": "Modules\nPython, on its own, requires a lot of manual programming for advanced tasks. What makes it versatile is the capacity to use other people’s code with modules.\nTo bring in advanced variables and functions that other’s have made, we need to import the module. For example\npi\nreturns an error, because it’s undefined. But the math module contains a variable called pi:\nimport math\nmath.pi\n\nTo access objects from within a module, we use a full stop: module.object_inside.\n\n\nNumPy for arrays\nArrays are a data type introduced by numpy, a module with many functions useful for numerical computing.\nFor example, you can convert the list we created before to then do mathematical operations on each one of its elements:\nimport numpy as np\nexample_array = np.array(example_numbers)\nexample_array * 2\n\n\nPandas for dataframes\npandas introduces dataframes, which are often used to store two-dimensional datasets with different kinds of variables in each column. If your data is stored as a spreadsheet, you probably want to import it with a pandas function.\nHere is an example of creating a pandas dataframe from scratch, populating it by hand:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create initial dataframe\ndf = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Name', 'Age'])\n\n# Populate with data\ndf.loc[1] = 'Josephine', 70\ndf.loc[2] = 'Dilsah', 38\n\ndf\n\nYou can double-click on a dataframe in the Variable explorer to explore it in a separate window.\n\n\n\nMatplotlib for visualisation\nmatplotlib is a large collection of data visualisation functions, and pyplot is a submodule of matplotlib that contains essentials.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot(example_array)\nThis shows a plot in the Plots tab of Spyder.\n\nIn a Python shell, you might have to use the plt.show() command to show the plot.\n\nThe default look is a line plot that joins all the points, but we can style a plot with only a few characters:\n# blue circles\nplt.plot(example_array, 'bo')\n\n# green squares, dashed line:\nplt.plot(example_array, 'gs--')\nExtra arguments can be used to style further:\n# red, diamonds, solid line; change width of line and size of diamonds:\nplt.plot(example_array, 'rd-', linewidth=3, markersize=10)\nTo find out about the styling shorthand and all other arguments, look at the documentation:\nplt.plot?\n\n\nInstalling modules that aren’t built in\nThe math module is built-in - the module came when I installed Python, and the numpy, pandas and matplotlib come with conda installations. Most other modules live online, so we need to download and install them first.\nInstalling modules depends on whether you have a conda environment or not. To check, run\nconda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessage\nconda Environment?\n\n\n\n\nconda is a tool for managing and deployi... or something similar\nYes\n\n\nNameError: name 'conda' is not defined\nNo\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a conda environment\nYou can install packages with\nconda install package_name\n\nYou likely have a conda environment if you installed Anaconda or you installed Spyder 6 (Since Oct 2024)\n\n\n\nIf you do not have a conda environment\nYou can install packages with\npip install package_name\n\nYou likely have a pip environment if you installed Python manually and/or are not using Spyder\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express for interactive visualisations\nOne module that isn’t built-in is plotly, which we can use for interactive visualisations.\nimport plotly.io as pio\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Set renderer\npio.renderers.default='browser'\n\n# Create bar plot\npx.bar(df, x = \"Name\", y = \"Age\")",

    "text": "Summary\nThis morning we looked at a lot of Python features, so don’t worry if they haven’t all sunk in. Programming is best learned through practice, so keep at it! Here’s a rundown of the concepts we covered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept\nDesctiption\n\n\n\n\nThe console vs scripts\nThe console is our window into the computer, this is where we send code directly to the computer. Scripts are files which we can write, edit, store and run code, that’s where you’ll write most of your Python.\n\n\nVariables\nVariables are the nouns of programming, this is where we store information, the objects and things of our coding. They come in different types like integers, strings and lists.\n\n\nIndexing\nIn order to access elements of a sequence variable, like a list, we need to index, e.g. example_numbers[2]. Python counts from 0.\n\n\nFunctions\nFunctions are the verbs of programming, they perform actions on our variables. Call the function by name and put inputs inside parentheses, e.g. round(2.5)\n\n\nHelp\nRunning help( ... ) will reveal the help documentation about a function or type.\n\n\nPackages\nWe can bring external code into our environment with import .... This is how we use packages, an essential for Python. Don’t forget to install the package first!",
